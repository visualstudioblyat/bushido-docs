## Download

Grab the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/visualstudioblyat/bushido/releases).

Bushido runs on Windows. macOS and Linux builds are coming.

## First Launch

On first launch you'll see the new tab page with a clock, greeting, and search bar. Start browsing — ad blocking, cookie rejection, and HTTPS-only are on by default.

Your session is saved automatically. Close the browser, reopen it, and your tabs are right where you left them.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- WebView2 runtime (ships with Windows 11, auto-installs on Windows 10)
