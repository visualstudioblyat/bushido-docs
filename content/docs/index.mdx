Welcome to the Bushido docs. Everything you need to know about using and building the browser.

## What is Bushido?

Bushido is a desktop browser built with Tauri v2 (Rust) and React. Ad blocking, cookie rejection, and HTTPS-only mode are built into the core — not extensions that can be disabled by Google.
