title: Compact Mode
description: Auto-hide the sidebar for a distraction-free view
---

Compact mode collapses the sidebar down to a 3px strip on the left edge. The webview gets the full window width. Hover the left edge to reveal the sidebar temporarily.

## Toggle It

- `Ctrl+Shift+B` from anywhere (works even when a webpage has focus)
- Settings page → Appearance → Compact mode toggle

Both stay in sync — flip one and the other updates.

## How It Works

When compact mode is on:
- Sidebar shrinks to 3px (just a thin line on the left)
- Hover the left edge to peek at the sidebar
- Move your mouse away and it hides again
- All tab operations still work while the sidebar is visible

## Session Persistence

Compact mode state saves with your session. Restart the browser and it remembers whether you had it on or off.
