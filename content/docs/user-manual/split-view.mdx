title: Split View
description: View multiple tabs side by side
---

Split your window into up to 4 panes. Each pane shows a different tab. Drag the dividers to resize.

## Opening a Split

- **Drag a tab** toward the content area — a preview zone appears showing where the tab will land (left, right, top, or bottom). Release to split.
- `Ctrl+\` — splits the current pane and adds the most recently used tab
- Right-click a tab → **Split with this tab**

## Resizing

Drag any divider between panes. Each pane has a minimum size of 15% so nothing gets too tiny.

During divider and split drags, webviews hide temporarily so the mouse tracks smoothly (WebView2 child windows are native OS windows that steal mouse events).

## Closing a Split

- `Ctrl+\` when only one split exists — exits split view
- Navigate to an internal page (`bushido://newtab`) in a pane to close that pane
- Close the tab that's in a pane

## Layout

The split layout is a recursive tree — you can split horizontally or vertically, and splits can nest. Up to 4 panes total.

## Session Persistence

Your split layout saves with your session. Restart the browser and the same panes reappear with the same tabs.

## Notes

- Opening a new tab exits split view (keeps things simple — you're starting a new task)
- The tab suspender skips any tab that's visible in a split pane
- Each workspace has its own split state
