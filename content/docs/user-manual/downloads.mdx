description: Built-in download manager with parallel chunked downloads, crash recovery, and cookie-aware resumption
---

Bushido has its own download engine built in Rust. No browser extension, no separate app. It intercepts every download, runs it through a custom pipeline, and gives you pause/resume, crash recovery, and multi-connection acceleration out of the box.

## How It Works

When you click a download link, Bushido intercepts it via WebView2's `DownloadStarting` event and suppresses the default browser UI. The file gets routed through our engine instead.

For files over 1MB on servers that support Range headers, Bushido splits the download into up to 6 simultaneous segments. Each segment grabs its own byte range and writes to the file at the exact offset. This saturates your bandwidth the way IDM does — except it's built into the browser.

For small files or servers without Range support, it falls back to a single connection. No unnecessary overhead.

## Parallel Chunked Downloads

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Default segments | 6 |
| Min file size for chunking | 1MB |
| Min segment size | 512KB |
| Dynamic splitting | Yes — idle workers split the largest remaining segment |

When a fast segment finishes early, the orchestrator finds the segment with the most bytes remaining and splits it at the midpoint. A new worker picks up the second half. No idle connections.

## Crash Recovery

Every download writes a manifest file (`.part.json`) to disk alongside the partial file. The manifest stores per-segment progress, byte ranges, and cookies. If bushido crashes or you close it mid-download, each segment resumes from where it left off when you reopen. Most browsers lose your progress on close.

## Cookie Extraction

When a download starts, bushido grabs all cookies for that URL from the browser's cookie jar via `ICoreWebView2_2::CookieManager` and passes them to the download engine. Downloads from authenticated sites (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) work without any extra setup.

## Download Panel

The download panel is a slide-over in the sidebar. Click the download icon to open it. It shows all active, paused, completed, and failed downloads with a badge for the active count.

### Controls

| State | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Downloading | Pause, cancel |
| Paused | Resume (if server supports Range), cancel |
| Completed | Open file, open folder |
| Failed | Retry, remove |

The segment count badge (e.g. "6x") shows next to the speed while a chunked download is running.

## Settings

In `bushido://settings` under Downloads:

- **Download location** — Where files save. Defaults to your system downloads folder.
- **Ask where to save** — Prompt for a location before every download.

## How It Compares

Chrome has parallel downloading behind a flag (`chrome://flags/#enable-parallel-downloading`), but it's off by default. None of the major browsers persist download state to disk — close the browser and your progress is gone. IDM handles all of this, but it's a $25 separate app with a browser extension. Bushido does it natively.
