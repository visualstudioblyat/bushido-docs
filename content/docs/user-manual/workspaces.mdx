Workspaces let you group tabs by context — work, personal, research, whatever. Each workspace has its own set of tabs, its own active tab, and its own color.

## How to Use

Workspace dots show up at the bottom of the sidebar. Click one to switch. Your tabs swap out instantly.

### Create a Workspace

Click the `+` button below the workspace dots. A new workspace opens with a fresh new tab page.

### Switch Workspaces

- Click a workspace dot in the sidebar
- `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` to jump by number

### Rename & Recolor

Right-click a workspace dot. You can rename it, pick a new color, or delete it (can't delete the last one).

### Move Tabs Between Workspaces

Right-click a tab and pick "Move to workspace." The tab moves over and becomes the active tab in the target workspace.

## Session Restore

Workspaces are saved to disk automatically. Close the browser, reopen, everything is exactly how you left it — same workspaces, same tabs, same active tab per workspace.
