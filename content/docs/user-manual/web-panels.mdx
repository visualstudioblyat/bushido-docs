Web panels let you keep sites like Spotify, Discord, or WhatsApp open in a narrow panel between the sidebar and your content area. They stay open across tab switches and survive restarts.

## Adding a Panel

1. Click the **+** button in the panel icon row (below workspaces, above tabs)
2. Pick a preset (Spotify, Discord, WhatsApp, YouTube Music, X, ChatGPT) or paste any URL
3. The panel opens at 350px wide between the sidebar and your tabs

## Using Panels

- **Click a panel icon** to toggle it open/closed
- **Right-click a panel icon** to remove it
- Only one panel is visible at a time — clicking a different icon switches to it
- Panels get a mobile user agent so sites serve mobile-friendly layouts at 350px

## How It Works

Panels are regular webviews created through the same `create_tab` pipeline — they get all the same security scripts, ad blocking, and cookie rejection. The difference is they're tracked separately in a `PanelState` so the tab layout engine doesn't hide them when repositioning tabs.

When a panel is open, the content area shrinks by 350px. Close the panel and it snaps back.

## Session Persistence

Panels save with your session. Restart the browser and your panels are still there — click the icon to reactivate.

## Compact Mode

Panels hide when compact mode is active. The sidebar collapses to 3px and the panel goes with it.

## Limitations

- Fixed 350px width (not resizable yet)
- One panel visible at a time
- Some sites may not work well with mobile UA (especially OAuth flows like Google sign-in)
