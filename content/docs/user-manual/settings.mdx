Open settings from the gear icon in the sidebar, or navigate to `bushido://settings`. It's a React-rendered page — no webview, loads instantly.

## Sections

### General

- **Search engine** — Google (default), DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, Bing, or custom URL with `%s` placeholder
- **On startup** — Restore previous session or open a new tab
- **Show top sites** — Toggle the frecency grid on the new tab page
- **Show clock** — Toggle the clock on the new tab page
- **Show greeting** — Toggle the time-based greeting

### Downloads

- **Download location** — Where files save (system default if empty)
- **Ask where to save** — Prompt before every download

### Privacy & Security

- **HTTPS-only mode** — Upgrade all connections to HTTPS, refuse HTTP
- **Ad blocker** — Toggle the content blocker on/off
- **Cookie banner auto-reject** — Toggle automatic "reject all" on consent popups
- **Clear data on exit** — Wipe history and cookies when closing

All of these actually control behavior. Turning off ad blocker stops injecting the content script. Turning off HTTPS-only allows HTTP navigation.

### Appearance

- **Compact mode** — Toggle compact mode (syncs with `Ctrl+Shift+B`)
- **Tab suspend timeout** — How long before inactive tabs get suspended

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Read-only reference of all shortcuts.

### About

Version number and project description.

## Persistence

Settings save to disk (debounced 500ms) and load before session restore on startup. They persist across restarts.
