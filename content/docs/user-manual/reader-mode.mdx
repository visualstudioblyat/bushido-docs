description: Strip pages to clean text with customizable font and theme

Reader mode strips a webpage down to its content — just the text and images, no ads, no sidebars, no clutter.

## Toggle It

`Ctrl+Shift+R` or click the reader icon in the sidebar. Press again to exit.

## What It Does

Bushido finds the main content on the page (looks for `<article>`, `<main>`, `[role="main"]`, or the largest text block) and renders it in a clean overlay. Everything else gets hidden.

## Customize

The reader has settings you can adjust:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Font size | 12px – 28px |
| Font | Serif or sans-serif |
| Theme | Dark, light, or sepia |
| Line width | 600px – 900px |

Changes apply instantly. Pick what's comfortable for your eyes.

## How It Works Under the Hood

Reader mode runs as a named Rust command (`toggle_reader`) that injects CSS and JS into the active webview. No arbitrary eval — it's a specific, scoped command. The original page content is preserved and restored when you exit.
