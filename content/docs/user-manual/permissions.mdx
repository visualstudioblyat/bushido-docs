title: Permission Prompts
description: Custom permission prompts for camera, microphone, location, notifications, and more
---

When a site requests access to your camera, microphone, location, or other sensitive APIs, Bushido shows a custom glass-style prompt instead of the default Chromium dialog.

## How It Works

Bushido intercepts permission requests at the WebView2 COM level using the `PermissionRequested` event handler. When a site asks for a permission, the request is deferred — Chromium's decision is paused — and a banner slides in at the top of the content area showing what the site wants.

You choose Allow or Deny. If "Remember" is checked (on by default), the decision is saved per-site so the prompt won't appear again for that domain and permission type.

## Supported Permissions

| Permission | Prompted? |
|------------|-----------|
| Microphone | Yes |
| Camera | Yes |
| Geolocation | Yes |
| Notifications | Yes |
| Clipboard Read | Yes |
| MIDI | Yes |
| Window Management | Yes |
| File Read/Write | Yes |
| Other Sensors | Yes |
| Multiple Downloads | Auto-allowed |
| Local Fonts | Auto-denied (fingerprint risk) |
| Autoplay | Follows your autoplay policy in Settings > Privacy |

## Saved Permissions

Saved decisions are stored to disk and loaded on startup. When you revisit a site that you previously allowed or denied, the decision is applied automatically — no prompt shown.

To view or manage saved permissions, go to Settings > Permissions. Each entry shows the domain, permission type, and whether it was allowed or denied. Click "Revoke" to remove a saved decision. The site will be prompted again on its next request.

## Auto-Decisions

Two permission types are handled automatically without showing a prompt:

- **Multiple Downloads** — always allowed. Sites that trigger multiple file downloads (like "download all" buttons) work without interruption.
- **Local Fonts** — always denied. Font enumeration is a high-entropy fingerprinting vector. Blocking it matches Bushido's fingerprint protection stance.
