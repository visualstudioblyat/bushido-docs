title: Media Controls
description: Control audio and video from the sidebar
---

When a tab is playing audio or video, a mini player bar appears at the bottom of the sidebar. Control playback without switching tabs.

## What It Shows

- Favicon and title of the tab playing media
- Play/pause button
- Mute button
- Click the bar to switch to that tab

## How It Works

Bushido injects a media detection script into every page that polls for `<audio>` and `<video>` elements every 1.5 seconds. When it finds active media, it reports the state back to the sidebar via `postMessage` IPC.

Polling is used instead of event listeners because YouTube and some other sites don't fire standard media events reliably in WebView2 initialization scripts.

## Behavior

- The media bar persists across tab switches — you can browse other tabs while music plays
- Play/pause and mute send commands to the media tab without switching to it
- If multiple tabs have media, the bar shows the most recently active one
