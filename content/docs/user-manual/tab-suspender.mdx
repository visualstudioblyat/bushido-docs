title: Tab Suspender
description: Auto-suspend inactive tabs to save memory
---

Tabs you haven't used in a while get suspended automatically. The webview is destroyed, freeing memory. The tab stays in your sidebar with a zzz badge so you know it's sleeping.

## How It Works

- Bushido checks every 60 seconds for tabs that haven't been active
- If a tab has been inactive longer than the timeout, it gets suspended
- The webview is destroyed but the tab keeps its title, URL, and favicon
- Click a suspended tab to restore it — the webview recreates and loads the page

## What Never Gets Suspended

- **Pinned tabs** — they're always safe
- **The active tab** — the one you're looking at
- **Internal pages** — `bushido://newtab`, `bushido://settings`

## Configure the Timeout

Settings → Appearance → Tab suspend timeout

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 5 minutes | Default — aggressive memory saving |
| 10 minutes | A bit more relaxed |
| 15 minutes | Moderate |
| 30 minutes | Only suspend if you really forget about it |
| Never | Disable tab suspending entirely |
