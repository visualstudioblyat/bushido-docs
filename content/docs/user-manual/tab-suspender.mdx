title: Tab Suspender
description: Auto-suspend inactive tabs to save memory
---

Every tab is its own process. Each one eats 120-180MB of RAM. The tab suspender puts idle tabs to sleep so they stop hogging memory without losing your place.

## Three States

Bushido uses the same `TrySuspend` API that Edge uses for sleeping tabs. Tabs move through three states as they sit idle:

| State | Memory | What happens when you click it | When |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------|------|
| **Active** | ~200MB | Already there | In use |
| **Suspended** | ~30MB | Wakes up instantly — scroll position, form state, everything intact | Idle 2 min |
| **Destroyed** | 0MB | Full page reload | Idle 5 min |

Both suspended and destroyed tabs show a zzz badge in the sidebar. The difference is what happens when you click them — suspended tabs come back instantly, destroyed tabs reload from scratch.

## What Never Gets Suspended

- **The active tab** — obviously
- **Tabs in split view** — if you can see it, it stays awake
- **Pinned tabs** — always safe
- **Tabs playing media** — Spotify in a background tab won't get killed
- **Internal pages** — `bushido://newtab`, `bushido://settings`

## Configure the Timeout

Settings → Appearance → Tab suspend timeout

You set the destroy timeout. The suspend timeout is automatically 40% of that (capped at 2 minutes).

| Setting | Suspends at | Destroys at |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| 5 min (default) | 2 min | 5 min |
| 10 min | 4 min | 10 min |
| 15 min | 6 min | 15 min |
| 30 min | 12 min | 30 min |
| Never | — | — |
