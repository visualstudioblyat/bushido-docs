description: Pop videos out of the page into a floating window

Bushido auto-detects videos on the page. When it finds one, a PiP button appears in the sidebar.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a page with a video (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
2. Wait a moment — Bushido polls for video elements
3. The PiP button appears in the sidebar
4. Click it — the video pops into a floating window

Click the PiP button again to exit, or close the floating video.

## How It Works

Bushido runs a named Rust command (`detect_video`) that checks for `<video>` elements on the page. When you click PiP, another command (`toggle_pip`) injects a Shadow DOM overlay with a button that calls the browser's native `requestPictureInPicture()` API.

The Shadow DOM means sites can't detect or block the PiP button — it's invisible to page scripts.

## Limitations

- The page needs an actual `<video>` element (some sites use custom players that don't expose one)
- Some sites block PiP at the API level — Bushido removes the `disablePictureInPicture` attribute but can't override everything
