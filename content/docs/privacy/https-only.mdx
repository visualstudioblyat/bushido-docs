title: HTTPS-Only Mode
description: All traffic upgraded to HTTPS, HTTP connections refused
---

HTTPS-only mode is on by default. Every connection gets upgraded to HTTPS. If a site only serves HTTP, the navigation is blocked.

## How It Works

Two things happen:

1. **URL upgrade** — When you type `http://example.com` or a page links to it, Bushido rewrites it to `https://example.com` before making the request
2. **Navigation guard** — The `on_navigation` callback in Rust checks every URL. If it starts with `http://` and HTTPS-only is enabled, the navigation returns `false` and the page doesn't load

## Toggle On/Off

Settings → Privacy & Security → HTTPS-only mode

When you turn it off, HTTP URLs are allowed through without upgrading. Useful if you're on a local network or hitting a dev server.

## Why It Matters

HTTP traffic is unencrypted. Anyone on your network (coffee shop wifi, ISP, etc.) can see exactly what you're doing. HTTPS encrypts the connection between you and the server.

Most sites support HTTPS now. The ones that don't are usually sketchy.
