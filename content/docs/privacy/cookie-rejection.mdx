title: Cookie Banner Rejection
description: Automatically dismiss cookie consent popups
---

Bushido auto-clicks "reject all" on cookie consent banners. You never see them.

## How It Works

A script (`cookie_blocker.js`) is injected into every page. It knows about 8+ consent frameworks:

- OneTrust
- CookieBot
- Didomi
- TrustArc
- Cookie Notice
- GDPR Cookie Consent
- Complianz
- Generic "reject" / "decline" buttons

The script watches for consent dialogs to appear (using `MutationObserver`) and clicks the reject/decline button automatically. If the banner uses an iframe, it handles that too.

## Toggle On/Off

Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookie banner auto-reject

When you turn it off, `cookie_blocker.js` stops being injected into new pages. You'll start seeing cookie banners again.

## Per-Site Whitelist

If a site is on your shield whitelist, cookie rejection is also disabled for that site (same as ad blocking).
